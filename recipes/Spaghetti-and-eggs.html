        <li>¾ cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Quarter sweet peppers lengthwise, remove and discard stems, seeds and membranes, then place them, cut side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet, 4 to 5 inches from the broiler.</li>
        <li><p>Broil peppers 8 to 10 minutes or until skins are blistered and dark, then remove from oven, bringing up the sides of foil to seal.</p> 
            <p>Let peppers stand about 15 minutes, then open foil and peel peppers, discarding skin.</p</li>
        <li>Chop peppers and stir into Marinara Pasta Sauce. Transfer Marinara Pasta Sauce mixture to an extra-large skillet and bring to a low simmer.</li>
        <li><p>Bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil, adding salt to taste and the Thin Spaghetti, stirring gently.</p> 
            <p>Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well.</p>
        <li><p>Add Thin Spaghetti to the skillet and toss with the Marinara Pasta Sauce mixture, stirring in the arugula.</p></li>
        
        <li>In a nonstick extra-large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat until hot. Break eggs, one at a time, into the pan; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li><p>Reduce heat to low and let cook until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard. Use a spatula to carefully flip each egg, and cook to desired doneness.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve pasta immediately, topped with fried eggs and Parmesan cheese.</p></li>
        </li>
